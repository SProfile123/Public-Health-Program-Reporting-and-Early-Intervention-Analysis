# 🏥 Public Health Data Analysis — BMI, Flu Shot & Pneumonia Vaccine Trends

## 📌 Overview
This project analyzes **Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS)** public health data to evaluate community health trends across U.S. states.  
The focus is on **BMI, Flu Shot Coverage, and Pneumonia Vaccination Rates**, aligning with **public health performance monitoring and early intervention program evaluation**.

The project showcases **end-to-end public health data workflows**, including:
- Cleaning and preparing large-scale health survey data  
- Running **SQL & SAS scripts** for summary statistics and regression  
- Using **Python (Google Colab)** for exploratory analysis  
- Building **Power BI dashboards** for reporting and stakeholder communication  

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Measure **average and median BMI** across U.S. states.  
- Track **flu shot coverage** trends over time at state level.  
- Assess **pneumonia vaccine uptake** across populations.  
- Provide **state-level performance monitoring dashboards** for public health programs.  

---

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- **Python (Pandas, SQLite)** → Data cleaning, SQL execution in Colab  
- **SQL** → Aggregations, trend analysis, median BMI calculation  
- **SAS** → Summary statistics, frequency tables, regression & univariate analysis  
- **Power BI** → Interactive dashboards for public health reporting  
- **Dataset** → BRFSS (CDC Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System)  

## 🔑 Key Insights
- States with **higher median BMI** showed **lower flu shot coverage**, suggesting possible risk factors.  
- **Flu shot uptake increased year-over-year** in most states, reflecting effective health campaigns.  
- **Pneumonia vaccination rates** remained low in several states, indicating a gap for intervention.

## 🚀 How to Run
1. **Python/Colab** → Open `Public_Health_Data_Analysis.ipynb` in Google Colab.  
2. **SQL** → Run queries in SQLite (via Colab) or any SQL environment.  
3. **SAS** → Upload `.sas` scripts into **SAS OnDemand Studio** and run.  
4. **Power BI** → Open `.pbix` files in Power BI Desktop to interact with dashboards.
